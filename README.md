Neste repositório encontram-se algumas de minhas análises sobre as contas nacionais da plataforma SIDRA

It’s not a secret that Brazil is passing through a hard phase. On contrary, ever since the beginning of the
second term of the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, Brazilian macroeconomic statistics have been showing
persistent decreases on its stats. Still, many economists argue that Dilma was doing some accounting tricks
so she could get reelected, and she did. But the thing is, Brazil passed through such a hard time after that,
that Dilma got impeached a bit over a year after she got into her second term. Was it worth it? Well, that is
simply something that only she could answer, but I don’t believe so. One of her political foes, even though
he was her vice president at that moment, got into her place, and Brazil stepped into a social and economic
mess never seem in tupiniquim lands before.

Naturally, even after Dilma’s impeachment, Brazil still suffered with this huge recession. Even though the
lowest part of this through happened around the impeachment process, between 2nd of December 2015 and
31st august 2016, the new president, Michel Temer, did not manage to get the Brazilian economy back
on track, although he alleged it. GDP seemed to be increasing a bit over one percent, but unemployment
continued to be a big issue. So, One could argue that the recession was over, but surely not the crisis.

Now, three quarters after Jair Bolsonaro got elected, things don’t seem to be much different. Data suggests
that the worst has already passed, but there are many other issues to tackle. Also, even though he got elected
by fair margin, this new government doesn’t really seem very united and a big part of its votes were aimed
to take PT out from power. Still, public investments, widespread subsidized credit and tax breaks play a big
part in Brazil’s GDP, something that the new Economy minister, Paulo Guedes, says that is gonna change.
In the graph below you may check the ups and downs of Brazil’s quarter on quarter percent variance on
GDP (blue), Consumer spending (green), private Investment (cadetblue) and Government spending (red).
This way, one could say that the worst has already passed, but we still have a pretty weak economy. Seems
that we got used to low growth. Also, note that the y axis represents the percentage variance, indicating
that the velocity of money in Brazil is considerably slow at the moment.

With all this massive public spending which Brazil has used to try and tackle its crisis, public debt went from
60 percent of the GDP in 2013 to 74 percent in 2017, the highest indebtedness among emerging economies,
according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). An issue so big to Brazil at the moment that the
institution has even forecasted a ratio of unbelievably 91.7 percent of its GDP by 2021.
Although the flow of dollars is positive again, in the previous years It was negative in Brazil. Fiscal policies
were such a problem here that some credit rating agencies have downgraded Brazil, which decreased even
more the flow of money to Brazil. Even a big Ford Motors factory has recently closed down, letting around
2700 people out of work in São Paulo, which can be seen as not a good thing for investments.
